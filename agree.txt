Hi Annie, 

I agree - the best pizza in NYC is in New Haven. 

We met at NMAAHC once when you were working with Megan. Or maybe Pam...I can't remember right now :|

Anyway, I don't have any contact for you so I'm going about reaching you via this pull request, which feels appropriate because I'm writing to inquire about hiring you for some personal Bash coding lessons. The work you did on mmfunctions is very close to what I am hoping to do with some of the scripts at NMAAHC and your understanding of the code for those scripts obviously surpasses mine.

So, would you have any interest in doing a few 1-2 hour coding lessons in NYC some weekend? If so, name your price! I'd love to get some specific instructions from you and my questions will be very specific becuase I basically want you to walk me through your process for most of the pull requests you made in the last 2 months. I'm sure I'll see you at AMIA and we can work some details out in-person then if this sounds like something you would be OK doing. 

In the meantime, reach me here if you have any thoughts/questions - bleakleym@gmail.com

Thanks!
Blake
